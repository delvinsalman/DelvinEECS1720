# Quiz 4 Questions


## Week 01

(1. `(Setup)` What is a repo and why do we use them?) `Answer:` A repo is something that can be known as a storage, and you can put any type projects in there, like code, images, etc. 

(2. `(Version Control)` Why do we use version control? How did you manage making use of this? Be specific.) `Answer:` I think it is to allow software teams track changes to the code. ALSO, for managing. How I managed to use this is by learning, and almost always remembering to do use it. 

(3. `(Processing)` Why is processing similar across at least three languages (Java, Python, JavaScript)? What might be the point of this?) `Answer:` In terms of processing and its similar code, we can see it as it being multi language, and how all the three language listed they all have simlary like coding. The point of this can be anything such as, having multi similar languages to code and things that can go hand in hand in terms of var, code, and useage. 

## Week 02

(1. `(IDEs)` What IDEs did you use over the last 3.5 months?) `Answer:` The IDE I always used was VS CODE. Why?, I find it better to use and more user friendly for a beginner like me.

(2. `(UI & UI Elements)` Give me a specific example of where you considered UI in any of your course content submissions?)  `Answer:` In terms of UI I would say I used it for AR based stuffin terms of the QR coding, server hosting and what not. Also projects such as the extensions ones and others that use web pages. 

(3. `(JSON)` What exactly is JSON? Decide how you want to answer this.) `Answer:` I like to think that JSON files are like a storage, that transmit data objects. Like sending data, web applications and other syntax type stuff.  

(4. `(CLI & GUI)` Give me at least 3 ways we used GitHub and explain the difference between local and remote copies of a repo.) `Answer:` We used github to, clone, fork, and send many things in terms of the difference with local and remote copies, local is more based on the local place and local network. Remote copy would be you copying or cloning something via github.

(5. `(Debug)` What magical number-letter combo helps us debug in the browser? (What is a cross-origin error?) How can I display console content?) `Answer:` F12, for me it would be, FN, then the F12 button but something still using F12. A cross origin error may be something like a violating in the CORS security that not allowing whatever your doing. You can also display things in many by right clicking all the time and picking things like elements. 

## Week 03

(1. `(Browsers, Extensions)` Interaction with the browser through extensions required at least 2 things. Tell me what you think they are. There is a correct answer, and I talked about it in a January video.) `Answer:` Im pretty sure you would need things such as JSON files, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the code. And the UI elements of it. Not very sure since it was a while ago doing it lol. 

(2. `(DOM, Selectors, Elements)` How are these related?) `Answer:` They are all connected cause they all connect to each other in some way. If its in the html body, or different elements in the javascript. You can think of it as they all have a connection when being used cause they can help out with the code. 

(3. `(JavaScript OOP)` Show me 2 specific ways you used an OOP style in your course content submissions. Where did I use OOP in my p5.js updates?) `Answer:` Where I used OOP is when working with processing, and when doing quiz 2 with the family and classes we made for them. We went very into it so I work on it much there. In theres of the prof we used it for some code classes for processing, and also just when teaching in lectrue. 

## Week 04

(1. `(Python)` Show me where you completed the try these instructions from Feb 3) `Answer:` In terms of where I did these was when we where in lecture doing live and sumbmitted it as a part of my 100 days of code work in making it. When trying to experience and see how I could work with these. 

(2. Describe and list common attributes of any object-oriented programming language.) `Answer:` There can be many common things such as, data, data storage, data stored inside a class, And most of the time they repersent a state or quality towards that data or that class and whatnot. 

## Week 05

(1. `(Python OOP)` Write a python class for a classy robot that has the following: a name, an age, and can start and stop dancing when you clap. You can do it in under 10 lines (it can be pseudo-code like).) `Answer:` Lets start, Void Setup();, size: 650, 650, name= Delvin, age= 100, Void Draw, "Make a class for dancing and claping", for every clap, dance stops, for every time dance, dance is danceing, program end when person claps, END. 

(2. `(APIs)` What API did you connect with in Lab 2? Briefly explain how you integrated interactivity within your code.) `Answer:` In my lab 2 I made a discord bot using the discord token api to connect it to my code using python to make the bot work. The token worked as my special function to call the bot, and make the bot work like using commands in discord to prove that such as !help. I have intergrated interactivity was by using the api to call the bot and using the code in python and make them go hand in hand in coding a discord bot from the start, also know as hard coding since you can download any discord bot you really want. 


## Week 06

(1. `(Server-Client)` Give me an example of an interaction done client-side and an interaction done server-side.) `Answer:` Well we can say for the AR when using a marker to bring out a image or model. Say on the client side a person is using there phone to maybe scan a qr code. In terms of client, the software that can run on a user's web browsers, such as the project we did for phase 2. The server side is more like the heroku part or github pages, and is to use to host out server on the web in a free basic way. 

2. `(Local Hosting)` What is the difference between dragging an index.html file into your browser and opening an index.html file using localhost? Do you remember the number equivalent to localhost? `Answer:` In terms of the number equivalent it would be what we used like 127.0. 0.1, and 8000. When draging a file on index.html the file can just open on any web browser and show content you may have. When using local host you would have to run what ever it is your doing in the terminal panel to make that server start to run and be hosted via the server. Cause the other way of the html page is not hosted on a server and anyone can open it. 


## Week 07

(1. `(GitHub Pages)` What is a deployment in this context? What is a branch and why are they used for contributing to repos?) `Answer:` The deployment of this can be involved in getting new software or hardware up and running properly in its environment. In terms of branches I like to think of it as a way to organize files and make certain, and also think of it as a designated area for doing works for a say a file or code. Such as git-pages...

(2. `(Augmented Reality)` What makes AR possible? What is needed in a code context?) `Answer:` Somethings that make AR possible can be, models, code, structure, physical world, idea of physics, and other concepts to make ar happen, such as maybe making a model pop out. Somethings needed to do ar can be, models, ar code, server hosting if wished, code, it can be python, js, html, css. All these thing can come into play when doing something in respects to AR, they may be more but this is all I have understood when doing these type of things. 


## Week 08

(1. `(Aesthetics)` Give me a specific example of where you considered aesthetic design in any of your course content?) `Answer:` In honesty, I think in all the projects I have done have some type of aesthetic design to them. But one I think had the most aesthetic look and art realted thing can be something like the lab 3 we did, with hosting it on heroku and creating a web pages based off html and css. I made it so it has a moving background look with cool looking buttons to go with it. But in general every project I have done i have thought of the design look and I think that is a big part in making it. 

(2. `(APIs For Extending Integration)` Identify where in your code, for Quiz 1, Quiz 2, Quiz 3, Lab 1, Lab 2, Lab 3 that either you used an API or where you could integrate an API (it could be that we added API access in the lecture example and you used the same - still identify this).) `Answer:` In terms of the project and what we can add API with, I could most things can integrate into but one I think can most is, quiz 2 with the robots and familys. We could use the classes to go hand and hand with api calling in using it do something cool and different. That would be a different process but its something you can definitely add in your code to use the api feature.
