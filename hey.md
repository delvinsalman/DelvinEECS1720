# Quiz 4 Questions


## Week 01

(1. (Setup) What is a repo and why do we use them?) Answer: A repo is something that can be known as a storage, and you can put any type projects in there, like code, images, etc. 

(2. (Version Control) Why do we use version control? How did you manage making use of this? Be specific.) Answer: I think it is to allow software teams track changes to the code.
ALSO, for managing. How I managed to use this is by learning, and almost always remembering to do use it. 

(3. (Processing) Answer: Why is processing similar across at least three languages (Java, Python, JavaScript)? What might be the point of this?) Answer: In terms of processing and
its similar code, we can see it as it being multi language, and how all the three language listed they all have simlary like coding. The point of this can be anything such
as, having multi similar languages to code and things that can go hand in hand in terms of var, code, and useage. 


## Week 02

(1. (IDEs) Answer: What IDEs did you use over the last 3.5 months?) The IDE I always used was VS CODE. Why?, I find it better to use and more user friendly for a beginner like me.

(2. (UI & UI Elements) Answer: Give me a specific example of where you considered UI in any of your course content submissions?) In terms of UI I would say I used it for AR based stuff
in terms of the QR coding, server hosting and what not. Also projects such as the extensions ones and others that use web pages. 

(3. (JSON) What exactly is JSON? Decide how you want to answer this.) Answer: I like to think that JSON files are like a storage, that transmit data objects. Like sending data, web applications
and other syntax type stuff.  

(4. (CLI & GUI) Give me at least 3 ways we used GitHub and explain the difference between local and remote copies of a repo.) Answer: We used github to, clone, fork, and send many things
in terms of the difference with local and remote copies, local is more based on the local place and local network. Remote copy would be you copying or cloning something via
github.

(5. (Debug) What magical number-letter combo helps us debug in the browser? (What is a cross-origin error?) How can I display console content?) Answer: F12, for me it would be, FN, then the F12
button but something still using F12. A cross origin error may be something like a violating in the CORS security that not allowing whatever your doing. You can also display things in many
by right clicking all the time and picking things like elements. 

## Week 03

(1. (Browsers, Extensions) Interaction with the browser through extensions required at least 2 things. Tell me what you think they are. There is a correct answer, and I talked about it in a January video.)
Answer: Im pretty sure you would need things such as JSON files, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the code. And the UI elements of it. Not very sure since it was a while ago doing it lol. 

(2. (DOM, Selectors, Elements) How are these related?) Answer: They are all connected cause they all connect to each other in some way. If its in the html body, or different elements in the 
javascript. You can think of it as they all have a connection when being used cause they can help out with the code. 

(3. (JavaScript OOP) Show me 2 specific ways you used an OOP style in your course content submissions. Where did I use OOP in my p5.js updates?) Answer:
