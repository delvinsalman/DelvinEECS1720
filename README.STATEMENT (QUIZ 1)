README:
in terms of how to run the program, you would just go to the html file, "sketch" and open it via firefox to see the webpage. In terms of what i changed, i played around with
the numbers in terms of frequency, length of the border, audio to make it match what im feeling in terms of emotion, added in the html the emotion i was feeling as a header,
made the squares of the changing colors larger to also express how I was feeling, and some other numbers where changed just to make the audio to something i liked in terms of 
getting it to the right tone of output it was giving. :)

STATEMENT:
In terms of the aesthetic, and emotion part, the emotion i choose was "Happy" and it was at random when choosing it so thats why. Put how i made the sound output the emotion
happy was by making the beat and the way the sound was in a happy tone way in terms of how it sounds. You will see it to be more pumped up sound and a more song a person
would jam to when they are happy. And in my view art comes in many forms and one is color when seeing it, so when the colors of the sqaures where changing colors, in my
min i see that as happy and something postive. When i see the music i can see how it is high pitch and jammy to listen to which i would see as happy, in which case thats
what i feel when listing to it. These are some factors to why the code helped to express this emotion, and if we would think about it, if i whwere to do a sad emotion i 
would make the sound very low pitch and as if something is sad in the music when outputing it. But this was my take on something i felt to be happy and the emotion. "Happy"
when using the sound.
