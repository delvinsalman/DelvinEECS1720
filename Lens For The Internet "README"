Note: The extension will be available as if you where to use it on "Chrome" and will be using VSCode text editor to make it.
Note: This is a "READ ME" for the final project extension "Lens For The Internet" and will have a summary and even steps on what it is and the purpose of me doing it. 

INFO: This extension project was made up into two parts, one was a mix of things and two was just making it a useable extension. What this extension does is, 
it is a website blocker and background color changer for any website on the web. So for example one of the linked websites I have put is, .facebook.com and if you where
to have this extension active on the computer it would block you from going to the site since the extension is active and thats what its meant to do. And for the color side
of it i made it so you can write any color you want and it will change the background of the website page if you where to search somethings, and example can be, searching
"Apple" and enter the color "Red" it will then change the background of that page.
