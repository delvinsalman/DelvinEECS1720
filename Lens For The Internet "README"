Note: The extension will be available as if you where to use it on "Chrome" and will be using VSCode text editor to make it.
Note: This is a "READ ME" for the final project extension "Lens For The Internet" and will have a summary and even steps on what it is and the purpose of me doing it. 

INFO ON EXTENSION: This extension project was made up into two parts, one was a mix of things and two was just making it a useable extension. What this extension does is, 
it is a website blocker and background color changer for any website on the web. So for example one of the linked websites I have put is, .facebook.com and if you where
to have this extension active on the computer it would block you from going to the site since the extension is active and thats what its meant to do. And for the color side
of it i made it so you can write any color you want and it will change the background of the website page if you where to search somethings, and example can be, searching
"Apple" and enter the color "Red" it will then change the background of that page. Why I decided to make this extension is due to how, i thought mixing in something usefull
and something art related would go hand in hand in making the extension since its a open ended extension in terms of what to make and ideas. Also, to mention the purpose of 
this assignment is to create something you like in the form of coding it, so such things can be like making this assignment using, js,html,css,json and etc, AND i thought of 
it as a fun little extension to make that is also cool and usefull! The meaning of this extension can be anything, such as how it block websites that you wish to block, or how 
it can change the color of the background to you like, these are all factors I see to be usefull and fun to use in a code and art viewpoint, of course this extension is not
life changing but it does something effective to how I things. :) Also things like the icon I used was just a neat way in representing something about me which was the picture 
"D" that implies to the first letter of my name!


These are the list of websites i used to be blocked when trying to use them, when also having the extension active. (They are randomly chosen) 


        "*://*.facebook.com/*",

	"*://.sketch.io.com//*",

	"*://*.mathgames.com/*",

	"*://*.aircanada.com/*",

	"*://*.y8.com/*",

	"*://*.twitter.com/*",


*Also make sure to pin the extension so that you can use it conveniently.
