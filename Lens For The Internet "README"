Note: The extension will be available as if you where to use it on "Chrome" and will be using VSCode text editor to make it.
Note: This is a "READ ME" for the final project extension "Lens For The Internet" and will have a summary and even steps on what it is and the purpose of me doing it. 

INFO: This extension project was made up into two parts, one was a mix of things and two was just making it a useable extension. What this extension does is, it is a website blocker and background color changer for any website on the web.
